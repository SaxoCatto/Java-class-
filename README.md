# Java-class-
My experience as i learn more nuances of Java class. I  am learning from Udemy and other pdfs, so this is like a scrap book.

One of the few problems that I have  is that how Java processes the code chronologically. For example, in the Main class, i have "cHONKSTER", which sounds identical to "CHONKSTER".
But the amounts of money for each names are different (10k and 110k). So my work here is to rewrite the code so that Java will check the names first (and make it upper case), and proceed, not plucking like this.
I might forget to upload my progress here (alot), as I am checking out inheritance. Rip.
